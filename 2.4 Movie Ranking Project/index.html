<h1>Best movies according to rohith</h1>
<h2>These are my top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1.) Nuvvu ostha ante nenu oddu antana</h3>
<p>This movie is a great movie to describe human emotions and 
    also a out and out commercial entertainer.
    This is my all time favourite movie</p>
<h3>2.) Bahubali 2 </h3>
<p> This movie also touches upon the human sentiments and potrays 
    the relation between a mother and a son in accurate sense </p>
    <h3>3.) Balagam </h3>
<p> A greate movie for people to watch to leave away thier egos ,
    father son relation is potrayed in a eye-watery manner  </p>
